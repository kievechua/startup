Terminal on web, let you start your app easily. For example, 1 button press to start couchdb, redis server and etc. Also, can run most terminal command on it. For example, ls, pwd, cd .. and etc.

## Background
I start this project to make my development life easier, tired of start the couchdb, redis server and my nodejs app everyday from terminal. Beside that, previously I use this project as a playground to test some library like coffeescript, jade, and etc, so the code might be messy :P

## Installation
* Install nodejs.
* And run it as normal node app.
* node server/app.js
* Go to setting and add your config.
	* name    - couchdb
	* label   - CouchDB
	* command - couchdb (Command you run on Terminal)
	* link    - http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/

## Roadmap
* Clean up the code.
* have a proper testing environment.
